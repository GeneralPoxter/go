    <h1>Jason's Rational Function Graphing Problem</h1>
    <p>Problem #12</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Roots of the numerator are imaginary and therefore cannot be graphed without calculus</p>
    <p><b>Graph Annotations:</b> Refer to sign chart for when to graph positive/negative in the graph.<br>Refer to work on left to find location where graph intersects horizontal asymptote.<br>Y-intercept = -1/3 because inputting 0 for x in the function f(x) results in -1/3.</p>
